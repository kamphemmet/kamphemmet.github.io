There have been no major changes to the boundaries, however, the farm's appearance has changed over the years. The farm area was until 1987 about 30 hectares. In the map from 1704 of R&ouml;ks parish, we see a very typical farm of this century. The farms farmers 'leased' land by the owner at S&auml;tra, which at that time was the family Snoilsky. The bulk of the land is greena area and is used for pasture for the animals and can also be turned into winter feed. The small fields that are available are few and very small and used for the family's own needs.  Cabbage, potatoes and grain for flour or feed is grown.<a target="_blank" href="bilder_kamphemmets_historia/karta_1914_small1.jpg"><img border="1" src="bilder_kamphemmets_historia/karta_1914_small2.jpg" width="125" height="123" align="right" hspace="7" vspace="5"></a></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">If one then makes a big jump forward in time to 1914, much has changed. The farm limits have been straightened out and the farm is now owned by the user himself, like many other estates. Much of the pasture is now been used for growing crops. The cultivated areas have increased, but many of the fields are still small. The farmer lives now completely on his farm but the land is still being processed largely by hand or with smaller machines. Servants and maids are used for assistance. Maids and servants had been on the farm for many years and used until only about 50 years ago. This map also has a

      map clarification</a>  which in more detail describes the numerical references on the map.</p>

      <img border="1" src="bilder_kamphemmets_historia/karta_1988_small2.jpg" width="189" height="154" align="left" hspace="7" vspace="5"></a>If we move 74 years ahead and look at the map from 1988, the amount of arable land has not increased so dramatically but instead the small patches gradually have merged and become larger as the tools and machines have streamlined agriculture. In 1987 Kamphemmets  was extended when my father Kurt bought Hagalund, which is 5 hectares (the green highlighted area on the map).

      <p class="MsoNormal">Kamphemmet has changed over the years both in terms of land, buildings and users. We see here the result of changes in Sweden's agricultural policy history. Rationalization and technological advances have changed the land use. There can also be seen a tendency for the farm changed its lessees with fairly regularity and the farmhands and maids were often not staying more than a year or two.
