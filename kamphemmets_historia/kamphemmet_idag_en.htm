<h1 align="center">Kamphemmet of today </h1>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Today, Kamphemmet consists of 35 acres, half arable and half pasture and woodland, which our family now have farmed since 1979. The farm is no longer a full time job, my parents take care of it at their leisure. There are no great incomes of farming but the land and the landscape is open and alive.
 </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">There is an area on the farm popularly called "Ekekullen". It lies between the house and the creek and has long been kept with a scythe to  keep open. Among other things, my grandfather Thore harvested grass for the animals there. My father Kurt gathered in 1979 for the first time some friends and had hay guild. This tradition has grown and today usually 20-25 friends and relatives gather in midsummer each year to jointly cut the grass on the field with scythe and then finish with a party together. In recent years the area has also been of interest to conservationists because some rare plants that thrive on hayfields. 
</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Livestock on the farm has gradually reduced more and more. Today (2005) only two cats and two horses can be found. One of the horses is owned by my aunt and uncle and the other is from a neighboring farm. Cultivation over the years has changed from being primarily composed of hay and other feeds, to today mostly consisting of cereals, legumes and oilseeds. The fields have been improved by drainage and stone clearance and are now relatively easy to attend.
