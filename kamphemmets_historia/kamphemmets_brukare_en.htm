To help to get an overview of those who lived on the farm you can look at the 
    <a target="_blank" href="bilder_kamphemmets_historia/tidslinje_kamphemmet.jpg">
    timeline</a>. </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">By the middle of the 1700s Anders J&ouml;nsson  came to Kamphemmet with his wife Anna Nilsdotter and their children, Nils, J&ouml;ns, Erik, and Marta. They stayed on the farm until the early 1800s. Peter Andersson took over about 40 years old with his wife Maja Gabriellsdotter and their three children, Anders, Sara Lena and Magnus. In 1807 the Anderson family moved to Kumla and left the farm in Anders Peterson's hands. His wife's name was Lena Maja  Salomonsdotter  and they had four children, Jonas, Catherine, Anna Brita and Anders Olofsson, who was born out of wedlock. The documents on the National Archives tells unfortunately not on when the family disappears from the farm and when the next user takes over but we know that Jonas Isacsson and his family were there in 1817. He had two children with his wife Maria Ericsdotter. Their names were Carl August and Maria Sophia. </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Now, a widower comes into the picture. He was named J&ouml;ns Larsson and moved to Kamphemet in 1834 with his son Johannes. J&ouml;ns also had a daughter named Johanna, but she only became two years old. When J&ouml;ns Larsson came to the farm he brought his new wife Magdalena Jonsdotter and her daughter Johanna Persson. Johanna moved  to S&auml;tra in 1835 . The son Johannes, moved as a teenager to  Svanshals, likely to become a farmhand. But J&ouml;ns Larsson did for some reason not take over the cultivation of the farm. Instead Peter Ljung came to Kamphemmet in 1835 with his wife Anna Brita Jonsdotter and their newborn daughter, Johanna. Anna Brita then gave birth to six children but none of them became more than three years old. Their only daughter, Johanna left home at age 20. Peter died in 1860, 53 years old. The farm changes hands, but the widow Anna Brita can live there until her death.  </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">The new farmers name was Carl Magnus Andersson and his wife Clara Louisa Andersdotter had a son named Carl Oscar. Shortly after they arrived at the farm, they had another son who they named Gustaf Albin and 1864, they had a daughter named Emilie Carolina. The family moved to Svanshals the next year and the farm was taken over by Carl August Lindstedt, who came from Heda and was 34 years old. He had with him his wife Johanna Andersdotter and children Emilie Mathilda, Carl Axel and Frans Oskar. They then had another child who was named Augustus Edward. </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">In 1867  the newly married couple Gustaf Adolf Carlson and Ida Maria Augusta Carlsdotter moved to Kamphemmet. They had a son who unfortunately died at birth but in 1880 they had a daughter named Maria Adolfina. Her mother died unfortunately just a weeks after the birth, and Gustaf Adolf was left a widower with his daughter. Two years later he married with Helena Margaretha Peterson. She came to the farm with her illegitimate son, Carl Axel Henning who was then 11 years old.  In 1885 the Carlsson family took on a foster child. The girl came from Nicolai in Stockholm and was named Thyra Augusta and was six years old.

    <img border="1" src="bilder_kamphemmets_historia/Kopekontrakt_Kamphemmet_1_low2.jpg" width="89" height="142" align="left" hspace="7" vspace="5"></a>Until now, the farmers had leased Kamphemmet from S&auml;tra. But in the summer of 1888, Anders Peter Gom&eacute;r bought Kamphemmet from the owner of S&auml;tra who was Ph Pharmansson and the Carlsson family moved to &auml;ngstugan. The purchase contract states that homestead owner Anders Peter Gom&eacute;r was allowed to buy the farm for 7500 Swedish crowns and then seven additional terms and conditions are written. These indicated, for example that the buyer would take over the farm in the state the tenant left it. The leaseholder was allowed to take with them and I quote "tools, fore-windows and other movable property belonging to the tenant." The leaseholder was prohibited to chop firewood and take with them, since it would accrue to the buyer. The buyer had to take over a mortgage, then pay the rest of the sum before October 15, 1890. Anders Peter Gom&eacute;r would also when this agreement was written transmit 200 Swedish crowns in deposits. Please read the purchase contract by clicking on the image.

    <p class="MsoNormal">Anders Peter Gom&eacute;r also owned F&ouml;lseryd. Kamphemmet was rented out again, to Oskar Sandberg, who lived at Kamphemmet from 1909 until 1914 when Anders Peter Gom&eacute;r died and his sons divided their father's property. The lease contract can be seen if you click on the image to the right. Karl August bought Kamphemmet for 10 050 Swedish crowns and moved there with his wife Anna Charlotta Andersson. They had three children, Svea, Astrid and my grandfather Thore who was born in 1913. Carl August died in 1921 and Anna became a widow 47 years old with three children. Anna ran the farm with the help of their children. She also had farmhands to help her. </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;My grandfather stayed on the farm to help his mother. He married in 1942, with Eva Sabel and they then took over the farm when Anna Charlotta died 1950. They bought the farm for 33 000. They had four children Inger Elisabeth, my mother Gunborg and Magnus. My grandfather farmed the property until 1975. My uncle Magnus took care of it a few years before my parents took over the lease. In 1979 my grandparents moved to &ouml;desh&ouml;g and we moved to the farm. In 1982 Thore and Eve signed away the farm to their four children, but in 1987 my parents bought Kamphemmet from my mother's siblings for 280 000 Swedish crowns. Me and my sister Martina now belong to the fifth generation of the family Gom&eacute;r of Kamphemmet and I hope it will remain a family farm in the future.
