      <p class="MsoNormal">In the 1800s there were in the yard a main building, a wing, three sheds and a barn. In the 1890s they moved  the barn. They tore down the old one that was placed at the road to Hagalund (see aerial photo below, paragraph 8) and built a new where it is today. When Karl August Gomér farmed the property, the wash-house was placed where it stands today. The house was originally in Dalbobeta and had been a blacksmith, but was then used in Kamphemmet as a wash-house and in recent years it was used for the slaughtering of pigs. Today it is like many other small buildings used only for storage. Karl Oskar also planned to build a manure outside the barn in order to have more animals. There were <a target="_blank" href="http://goto.glocalnet.net/kamphemmet_dokument/historiska_dokument/historiska_dokument_krono.htm#godselstadsritning">drawings</a> 
      and in 1916 he applied for <a target="_blank" href="http://goto.glocalnet.net/kamphemmet_dokument/historiska_dokument/historiska_dokument_krono.htm#godselstadslan">loans</a> from Östergötland County economy farm management committee, but the plans never became reality.</p>

      <img border="1" src="bilder_kamphemmets_historia/Ritning_animerad2_small.gif" align="right" hspace="7" vspace="5" width="200" height="136"></a>The main building, which was built around 1800, originally had a room and kitchen downstairs and a room with a kitchen and a hallway up on the second floor. In 1928, then the house was extended out the back. This extension became a kitchen. The house was bricked over and all the windows of the house were changed. They also built a porch.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">In 1952 the old pig and sheep shed was torn down and a wood shed and a chicken coop behind the house were built. They then moved over the hens from the hen house on the hill and small building is now a storeroom. Electric lights were installed in 1943 and in 1963 they built the toilet and hall on the front of the house. It also had electric heat and entrained water. In 1965 they built the barn for the storage of machinery and implements for agriculture.
</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">In recent times there has been some repairs to the main building. E.g. the upstairs kitchen has turned into a standard bedroom, closets have been built, some parts have been removed and the rooms have been wallpapered. At the turn of 1989-1990, there was a major renovation. The whole body of the house was extended to the west and on the lower floor was fitted with a new kitchen and upstairs another bedroom was made. The old kitchen was converted into a boiler room, laundry room and hallway. The entrance hall was removed and was replaced by a patio. The reason for the renovation was originally to put water heating instead of electric heat and iron stove which was the original source of heat. That same year, a machine shop behind the barn was built (see paragraph 10).
