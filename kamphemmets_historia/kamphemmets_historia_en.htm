      <p class="MsoNormal">Here, a typical farm in R&ouml;ks parish at the intersection of the open &ouml;sterg&ouml;tland and Holavedens dark forests is described. The farm is named Kamphemmet ("Struggle home"). On this farm  <a href="jag_en.htm">I</a> have grown up, and before my family moved here in 1979 <a target="_blank" href="bilder_kamphemmets_historia/ostergotland.jpg">
      <img border="1" src="bilder_kamphemmets_historia/sverige.jpg" align="left" hspace="7" vspace="5" width="76" height="160"></a>my grandparents lived on the farm and we were often there to visit them. The material presented here is originally a special project that I did in school in 1994. During the time that has passed since then, more information and material have appeared. Now, about 10 years later, an idea has matured to make the information digital and create a more readable version. I started from my original work, but have revised some parts and supplemented with new information. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">History has always been close to my heart and especially history concerning my own native environment. In my special project I chose to write about S&auml;tra because our family farm Kamphemmet has belonged to that manor. I realized pretty soon that it would be a far too large and extensive work to go in depth of S&auml;tra manor and limited the work to Kamphemmets own history during the past 300 years. I have written a short summary of S&auml;tra manor for you to get it into a context, but I am concentrating on Kamphemmet history. I have tried to give an insight into what the farm has looked like   when it comes to changes in the farm's history, owners, farmers, construction and cultivation of the earth.
