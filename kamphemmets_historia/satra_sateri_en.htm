<h1 align="center">Sätra manor</h1>
<p>Sätra is a large farm with a long history. The farm has for many years in its history belonged to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vadstena">Vadstena </a>monastery. The farm had been owned by the monastery there since 1399 when it was donated by Kristina Vimundsdotter. Sätra was later to belong to the crown but was replaced in the early 1600's by a district judge at the Vadstena castle, named Anders Grijs. Sätra thus became <a href="ordlista_en.htm">tenant manor </a>  and has had many owners until today. In order to study the owner history more closely you can look at the
<a target="_blank" href="bilder_kamphemmets_historia/tidslinje_satra.jpg">timeline
</a>of Sätra owners. </p>
          <p>The farm at that time was very large and had 18 crofts on the estates and five subordinate  <a href="ordlista_en.htm">homesteads</a>, 
           The manor also had its own mill and sawmill. The main building, located on the Sätra today was built in the 1700s.<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">.
          </span>
      <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"> It was modernized and got electricity, water and sewer in 1927. </span></p>

          <img border="1" src="bilder_kamphemmets_historia/hundgrav_small.jpg" width="317" height="334" align="left" alt="dog grave in Sätra"></a>Out on one of the fields adjacent to the main building of Sätra are two large trees which were originally 12 in number. There is an old contract that says that none of the trees may be felled by human hands. The reason may seem humorous, but in the early 1700's, one of king Karl the XII dogs was buried there. The dog had been brought home from the war in the Ukraine, which raged 1708-1709, by a soldier from Röks parish, who did not want the king's own dog to be buried in enemy territory. He then took the dog home and buried it there. Please read the local newspaper
          <a target="_blank" href="bilder_kamphemmets_historia/tidningsartikel_medium_2.jpg">
          article </a>from Wednesday, 15 September 1993. It tells more about king Karl the XII connection to the neighborhood. </p>
<p>Today Sätra is an ordinary large farm. Some of the subordinate crofts have been removed and has been redeemed and become summer or year-round housing. This change begun in the beginning of this century and kept on until present day. The subordinate
<a href="ordlista_en.htm">homesteads</a> were bought out and become their own farms and one of them is my childhood home Kamphemmet. </p>
